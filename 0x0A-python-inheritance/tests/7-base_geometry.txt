How to Use 7-base_geometry.py
=============================

This modules defines a base geometry class BaseGeometry.

Instantiation
=============

``BaseGeometry`` includes no attributes, and accordingly is initialized 
with no arguments.

::

    >>> BaseGeometry = __import__('7-base_geometry').BaseGeometry
    >>> bg = BaseGeometry()
    >>> type(bg)
    <class '7-base_geometry.BaseGeometry'>

::

    >>> print(bg) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <7-base_geometry.BaseGeometry object at ...>

In fact, any arguments supplied to an instantiation of ``BaseGeometry`` results
in a TypeError.
